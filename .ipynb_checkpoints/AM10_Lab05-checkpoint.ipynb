The modulo algorithm is also known as Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and is one of the most widely known methods of generating random numnber sequences. However, as you have seen from the lecture, the sequence of random numbers you can generate using LCG is not truely random. We call such sequences pseudorandom numbers (PRN). As you have heard from the lecture, the sequence of random numbers generated using this method starts repeating. In the examples and problems below you will explore how PRN sequences have a periodicity and how choosing the right constants for the LCG algorithm is key to generating longer periods. "

In this section, we will go thorough some of these tests for randomness and compare the psuedorandom sequences that we generate.

    "#### 1.4 The Random class from Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how to generate psuedorandom numbers algorithmically and how to test the quality of the randoness. However, as you might have realized genenrating good random numbers is not easy. Often PRNs could lead to a catastrophic failure because of not truely being random, like the RANDU generator from IBM. Therefore, it is always recommended to use random number generators that are extensively tested. Python has a built-in random number generator in the class `random`. You can generate PRNs by calling the function `random.random()`. See the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). The Numpy package also has a class called `random` that has more types of distributions. Both these packages use the same method to generate their PRNs, known as the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) algorithm, which is tested extensively and and known to be good. You can get familiar with the Numpy Random class through its [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html). The `np.random` class contains several functions to generate random real numbers, integers, bytes, etc. We used the function `np.random.random()` in a previous example. Also there are functions to generate random numbers with different distributions like exponential, normal, gamma, beta, etc. In the following exercises, we will exclusively use functions from the class `np.random`."

    "In its simplest form, a one dimentional Brownian walk is given by the following equation, $\\lambda dr/dt = \\eta$, where $\\lambda$ is a damping factor and $\\eta$ is a Gaussian noise term. Assuming $\\lambda=1$ and sampling from a normally distributed random variable, simulate three 50 second long trajectories of the 1D Brownian walk, i.e., calculate position as a function of time. Use a resolution of 0.1 seconds and plot the trajectories as a function of time. *Hint:* $r(t+dt) = r(t) + \\eta_i dt$. (We will look at propagation of solution in a later lecture and lab)"

    "From the lecture you have seen how random numbers can be used to integrate (i.e. find the area under the curve for a 1D function). This method, known as Monte Carlo integration can be very useful to integrate functions that cannot be integrated analytically. In its basic form, Monte Carlo intgration is simply a way to randomly sample a function to estimate its integral. If $F$ is the integral of the function $f(x)$ over the interval $(a, b)$. Then using the Monte Carlo integration method we can estimate $F$ as follows.\n",
